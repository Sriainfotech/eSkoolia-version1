# /media/* always goes through serve_media, which requires authentication
# and checks the requesting user's school owns the file — DEBUG and
# production both need this since uploaded documents contain student/staff
# PII. In real production, prefer serving /media/ via nginx/CDN with the
# same auth+ownership check (e.g. an auth_request subrequest to this view).
