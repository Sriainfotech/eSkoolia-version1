"""Tenant URL routes — served from a specific school's schema.

These routes handle all school-scoped data (students, academics, fees, etc.).
Each request that hits these routes already has the Postgres search_path
set to the school's schema by TenantMainMiddleware.

Active when MULTI_TENANCY_ENABLED=True and django-tenants routes
tenant-schema requests here. When the flag is off, config/urls.py
serves as the unified fallback.
